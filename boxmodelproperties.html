      <h1>Sachin Tendulkar</h1>
      <p>
        Sachin Tendulkar is one of the greatest cricketers in the history of the sport. Born on April 24, 1973, in Mumbai, India,
        he began playing cricket at a very young age and quickly rose through the ranks with his extraordinary talent. Known as
        the “Master Blaster” and the “Little Master,” Sachin made his debut for the Indian national team at the age of just 16,
        against Pakistan in 1989. Over the next two decades, he became a cricketing legend admired across the globe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tendulkar holds numerous records, including being the first cricketer to score 100 international centuries and the first
        to reach 200 runs in a One Day International (ODI). He is also the highest run-scorer in both Tests and ODIs. His calm
        attitude, incredible technique, and unmatched dedication made him a role model for millions. In 2011, he fulfilled a
        lifelong dream by helping India win the ICC Cricket World Cup. He retired from international cricket in 2013 after a
        glorious career spanning 24 years. For his contributions, he was awarded the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honor.
        Sachin Tendulkar remains a symbol of passion, humility, and excellence in sports.
